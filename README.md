# calkulate
Seawater total alkalinity from open-cell, non-purged, stepwise, potentiometric titration data

Here we present new software called Calkulate, which improves the efficiency and transparency of calculating seawater total alkalinity (TA) from potentiometric titration data, like that generated by the widely used Versatile INstrument for the Determination of Titration Alkalinity (VINDTA; Marianda, Kiel, Germany). The software runs in the MATLAB (MathWorks) computing environment. It determines TA using a modified Gran plot approach, which we have further developed to account for the commonly employed open-cell, non-purged titrations, and independent measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). We have also developed companion software called CalkCRM, which determines the molarity of the acid titrant based on a titration of reference material with known TA.
