# Stoichiometric dissociation constants

The [alkalinity solvers](../solvers) need values for the stoichiometric dissociation constant for each equilibrium that is active over the titration pH range in order to solve for alkalinity.  These are collated in a dict called `eqConstants`, to conveniently pass this information into the solver functions. The dict can be generated using the function of the same name in the `dissociation` module, or you can assemble your own manually.

All stoichiometric equilibrium constants are on the Free pH scale (as defined by [ZW01](../references/#ZW01)), and are valid only at a pressure of ~1 atm, unless otherwise specified.

---

## `eqConstants`: dict of equilibrium constants

Assemble a dict of equilibrium constants on the Free pH scale, as required by other Calkulate functions.

**Syntax:**

```python
eqConstants = calk.dissociation.eqConstants(tempK, psal, concTotals, WhichKs=10,
    WhoseKSO4=1, WhoseKF=1)
```

The `concTotals` dict input, generated by the function of the same name in the `concentrations` module (see [Total concentrations](../concentrations)), must contain at least the total sulfate and fluoride concentrations (with keys `S` and `F` respectively), which are required to convert all the equilibrium constants to the Free pH scale.

The output `eqConstants` dict contains the following constants, for dissociation of:

```python
concTotals = {
    'B': <boric acid>,
    'C1': <first carbonic acid>,
    'C2': <second carbonic acid>,
    'F': <hydrofluoric acid>,
    'P1': <first phosphoric acid>,
    'P2': <second phosphoric acid>,
    'P3': <third phosphoric acid>,
    'S': <bisulfate ion>,
    'Si': <orthosilicic acid>,
    'NH3': <ammonia>,
    'H2S': <hydrogen sulfide>,
}
```

The stoichiometric dissociation constants are calculated by [PyCO2SYS](https://github.com/mvdh7/PyCO2SYS). Inputs `WhichKs` and `WhoseKF` are the same as PyCO2SYS inputs `K1K2CONSTANTS` and `KFCONSTANT` respectively. Input `WhoseKSO4` corresponds to the PyCO2SYS input `KSO4CONSTANTS`: a value of `1` for `WhoseKSO4` is the same as options `1` and `3` for `KSO4CONSTANTS`, while a value of `2` is the same as options `2` and `4`.
