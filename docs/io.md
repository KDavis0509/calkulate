# Importing titration data

Titration data needs to be in the format described in [Variables and conventions](../conventions) in order to work with Calkulate functions. The `io` module contains a function to import text files generated by the widespread VINDTA instrument in a suitable format, or to load titration datasets that were simulated and reported by [D81](../references/#D81).

## Import VINDTA-style .dat files

The `io.vindta` function is useful if titration data is in the format typically generated by [a VINDTA instrument](http://www.marianda.com/index.php?site=products&subsite=vindta3c). This format is easy to replicate with any other sort of data that you may have.

**Syntax:**

```python
volAcid, emf, tempK = calk.io.vindta(datfile)
```

The input `datfile` is a string containing the .dat file's name (and path);

### What format is that?

A VINDTA spits out a text file with the extension '.dat' for each titration that usually looks something like this (with extra rows in place of the `...`):

    bottle	CRM-144-0435-4	0	0	0	0	0.00	0.00	35.000	4.000	0.00	0.0
    24.857	35.000	0.000	0.000
    0.000	187.600	24.857
    0.150	209.350	24.855
    0.300	236.800	24.857
    ...     ...     ...
    3.750	483.800	24.862
    3.900	486.350	24.865
    4.050	488.650	24.862

The first two lines contain various bits of user-inputted information about the sample. Other than skipping past them to the titration data, these lines are totally ignored by Calkulate.

The rest of the file has a row for each acid addition step in the titration. The space- or tab-separated columns are:

 1. Volume of acid added in ml;
 2. Measured EMF of the sample + acid mixture in mV;
 3. Temperature of the sample + acid mixture in Â°C.

## Simulated titrations

Titration data simulated by [D81](../references/#D81) and reported in his Tables 1 (without phosphate) and 4 (with phosphate) are available within Calkulate. They can be imported as follows:

```python
(massAcid, pH, tempK, massSample, concAcid, pSal, alk, concTotals,
      eqConstants) = calk.io.Dickson1981(withPhosphate=True)
```

The input `withPhosphate` is a logical determining whether titration data should include phosphate (default behaviour, `True`, [D81](../references/#D81) Table 4) or not (`False`, [D81](../references/#D81) Table 1).
