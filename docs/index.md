# <img src="img/logo_transparent.png" style="vertical-align:sub" width="105px" /> v2.2.0

Calkulate is a Python 3.6+ package for determining total alkalinity from seawater titration data.

## Installation

If you're using Conda, first create a new environment with Python 3.6+, NumPy 1.15+, and SciPy 1.1+ - or you can just allow Pip to install these dependencies for you. Other similar versions are probably fine, but untested. Then, to install:

    pip install calkulate

To upgrade in existing installation when there is a new release:

    pip install calkulate --upgrade --no-cache-dir

Since v2.2.0, Calkulate also requires [PyCO2SYS](https://github.com/mvdh7/PyCO2SYS) v1.1.1 or greater. This will be automatically installed by Pip if you don't have it.

## Get Calkulating!

This documentation is intended to present a broad overview of how Calkulate works, rather than provide a detailed syntactic reference for every constituent module and function.

Within Python, the import convention is:

```python
import calkulate as calk
```

To quickly get started with some analysis, jump straight to the [workflow examples](../examples/compare-all-solvers). These examples illustrate the different parts of Calkulate that you may need to use, and provide a framework that you can quickly modify to suit your own requirements.

To find out more about the principles by which Calkulate calculates things, take a look at the other parts of the documentation. These explain:

  * [Variables and conventions](conventions): the conventions for naming and defining the input and output variables;
  * [Data import](io): how to import titration data to work with;
  * [Total concentrations](concentrations): estimating total concentrations from salinity, or defining your own;
  * [Equilibrium constants](dissociation): defining stoichiometric equilibrium constants for the alkalinity solvers;
  * [Alkalinity solvers](solvers): the different methods by which alkalinity can be estimated from titration data;
  * [Titrant calibration](calibration): how to calibrate the acid titrant's concentration;
  * [Version history](versions): changes from version to version; and
  * [Literature references](references): a key to the codes used for citations.
